# Simple Snake Game

It was my final project for CSE115 (Programming Language I) Course at North South University. It was developed for windows based machine and I have avoided using graphics header by implementing it with the help of windows header.
## Getting Started
Before getting started please note that the program is written in C and no custom header was used. I have developed it in 2015 as a first semester student and since then could not have a chance to modify it.
## Prerequisites
In order to make this work, you will need the following tools and header files

### Tools

* PC with Windows OS (Windows 95 or greater)
* C Compiler
* A standard IDE to modify(I developed it using codeblocks although I highly recommend <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>)

### Header Files

* stdio.h
* stdlib.h
* conio.h
* ctype.h
* windows.h
* process.h


## Installing

Before you begin with this program please make sure you already have the mentioned header files installed. In case you need any help about these headers and their usage please follow through <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/header">this documentation</a>
Also don't forget to check comments within the code.

## Editing
You can try changing the speed of snake, background color, background size as well as food and snake icons. To do so please feel free to check the comments.

## Deployment
It's just a simple game made on windows header. If you can simply compile the code and make an exe file, you should be able to run it.
## Built With

* [C](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming) - Programming Language
* [windows.h](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383745(v=vs.85).aspx) - Windows Header for Compiler
* [Windows 8.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8) - Operating System
* [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads) - IDE

## Contributing
Anyone can edit, modify and use this code for any purpose. I have used several open source resources to develop it and prefer to leave this project as an open source one for everyone.
## Versioning
Since December, 2015 I could have a chance to modify or develop this project further. If necessary, feel free to fork it as you like.
