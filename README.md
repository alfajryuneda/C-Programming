## Synopsis
This is a collection of my lab work from first semester programming course CSE115 at North South University. Throughout this course, we were taught about the fundamental of programming using C Programming Language. This collection includes some of the very fundamental programming problem such as sorting, array manipulation, pointer operation along with a complete project of snake game.

## Code Example
I have tried to follow the best practices with the help of my instructor. Indentation, variable declaration and in later problems, function definition was implemented in appropriate manner to meet the standards.

## Motivation
The motivation behind these projects were to practice computer programming and learn fundamentals of C Programming Language.


## Installation
To run any of these projects, all you need is C compiler and an IDE to edit them. All of the sections are precisely segmanted so that I can go through it any time for the sake of revisiting the fundamentals.

## License
There is no restriction to modify, edit or implement these codes.
